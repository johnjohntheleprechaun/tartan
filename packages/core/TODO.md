-   Decide whether to remove the spec testing the order of priority of files when using `loadObjectFromFile`
-   Create a way to add processors for different file types
-   Create a way to ignore certain paths (maybe a regex or something)
-   Resolve the `package-lock.json` in a more dynamic way (searching upward until you find it)
-   Allow assets that are outside of the root directory, by moving it to somewhere in the root directory
-   Have some kind of prefix or something to let paths be relative to wherever the template you're using is located (but only for paths inside the template)
-   Register handlebars partials
-   the custom elements manifest is supposed to define elements in the exports section, but some things (like shoelace) have malformed manifests. This needs to be handled gracefully. Also, maybe I should make a pull request to shoelace.
-   Put custom element classes in the global scope and mark those imports as external when processing javascript
