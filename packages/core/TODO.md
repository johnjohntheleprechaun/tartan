- Decide whether to remove the spec testing the order of priority of files when using `loadObjectFromFile`
- Create a way to add processors for different file types
- Have some kind of prefix or something to let paths be relative to wherever the template you're using is located (but only for paths inside the template)
- Register handlebars partials
- the custom elements manifest is supposed to define elements in the exports section, but some things (like shoelace) have malformed manifests. This needs to be handled gracefully. Also, maybe I should make a pull request to shoelace.
- Put custom element classes in the global scope and mark those imports as external when processing javascript
- add an `extraAssets` and an `asset` page mode, to handle assets that aren't explicitly referenced in HTML
